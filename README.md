# 30 Days of Neural Networks Challenge

Welcome! This is my **30-day journey** to build and understand neural networks from scratch using Python & NumPy later PyTorch.

---

## Goals
- Build 1 neural network every day  
- Strengthen fundamentals (math, backprop, optimization)
- Cover important architectures: ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.
- Apply them on real datasets

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy / Matplotlib  
- PyTorch (for later stages)
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Progress Tracker

âœ… Day 01 â€” Single Neuron  
âœ… Day 02 â€” 2 Layer NN  
âœ… Day 03 â€” XOR Network  
ðŸ”„ Day 04 â€” In progress...
