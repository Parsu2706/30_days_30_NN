# 🧠 30 Days of Neural Networks Challenge

Welcome! This is my **30-day journey** to build and understand neural networks from scratch using Python & NumPy later PyTorch.

---

## 🧩 Goals
- Build 1 neural network every day  
- Strengthen fundamentals (math, backprop, optimization)
- Cover important architectures: ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.
- Apply them on real datasets

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy / Matplotlib  
- PyTorch (for later stages)
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🗓️ Progress Tracker

✅ Day 01 — Single Neuron  
✅ Day 02 — ANN Using pytorch  
✅ Day 03 — Multiclass classification (MNIST)ANN Using pytorch
